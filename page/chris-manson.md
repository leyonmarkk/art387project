The Kaytherian Society is the product of the world's greatest masterminds, Ian Lowery, Kayleigh Young and Katherine Leyonmark. It is an investigation of socio economics, surveillance, self-governance, and human behavior through Blockchain technology. This is a look into a future that is severely divided and relies on interpersonal monetized supervision and human decision-making.
