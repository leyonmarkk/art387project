Kaytherian takes a critical and foreboding look at one potential application of Blockchain technology. We as a society are approaching completely digital lifestyles and our individual and collective digital footprints are growing. The data we put into the world can be traced at all times, everything from governments and corporations to streaming applications know more about us than weâ€™d like to admit.

We chose to approach these ideas of data surveillance from a dystopian perspective; our project is a look into a future that is severely divided and relies on interpersonal monetized supervision and human decision-making. To exemplify this, we created 3d printed neural implant models, advertisements, and a website to tie it all together. We designed a neural implant with Blender that turns the human into the cryptocurrency miner; money is earned when criminal behavior is reported and confirmed. The implant is tethered, connecting three parts that each connect to a different part of the brain; the prefrontal cortex (decision making), the limbic system (emotional response), and the visual cortex. [Insert a bit about the future of tech advancement and human augmentation?]. Our futuristic and ominous advertisements were created in Adobe Photoshop and exist to represent the system and hypothetically draw people into it. All of these pieces are displayed on a website which people would hypothetically use to inform themselves and sign up to be a part of the system.

Our goal was to subvert the Blockchain technology and encourage audiences to consider the future of surveillance and data when there is incentive to watch and tattle on everyone around you, even those closest to you. What kind of societies and relationships could this result in?
